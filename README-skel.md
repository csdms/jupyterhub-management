# OpenEarthscape JupyterHub : frontier

Welcome! This *frontier* instance of the OpenEarthscape JupyterHub is designed for
running models.

Two global directories are provided in your home directory:

* `data`: A read-only place to house data
* `scratch`: A place to share code, notebooks, or other files with other users

If you have any questions about using this JupyterHub, please contact us
through the CSDMS Help Desk (https://github.com/csdms/help-desk).

CSDMS and the OpenEarthscape project are supported by the U.S. National Science
Foundation. See openearthscape.org for more information.
